# Architecture

## Build

No Gradle and no runtime libraries. `build.sh` runs `aapt2` (resources + assets) → `javac
--release 11` against `android.jar` (API 34) → `d8` (min API 24) → `zipalign` → `apksigner`.
Fonts (Inter, OFL) and the Presentation web app are plain assets; the QR encoder is vendored
source (Nayuki, MIT) under `src/io/nayuki/qrcodegen`.

## Code map

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `MainActivity.java` | Home screen: grid/dock, focus & move, launch zoom, top shelf (suggestions / Continue Watching), Liquid Glass, Control Center, profile switcher, menus |
| `SettingsActivity.java` | All settings, tvOS list layout |
| `Suggestions.java` | JustWatch / TMDB fetch, cache, artwork, deep links |
| `MediaWatchService.java` | Notification listener → media sessions → Continue Watching store; DND access |
| `Profiles.java` | Profiles (max 3), unique emoji avatars, per-profile storage names |
| `SleepReceiver.java` | Sleep via force-lock device admin; sleep timer alarm |
| `Inputs.java` | TV inputs from the TV input framework; switching via the passthrough channel URI |
| `News.java` | News for the top shelf: Indian newsrooms' RSS (India, local city, world), images, freshness |
| `Perms.java` | On-screen permission and default-home requests, with adb only as a last resort |
| `Weather.java` | Forecast from Open-Meteo, MET Norway or wttr.in (with fallback) in one format, IP location / city search, cache, refresh schedule |
| `WeatherView.java`, `WeatherIcons.java` | Weather overview card and forecast panel (drawn in code), multicolour weather icons |
| `Glyphs.java` | Line glyphs drawn in code (Control Center, Presentation tile) |
| `Ui.java` | Resolution-based sizing (960×540 design grid), fonts |
| `present/Presenter.java` | Presentation entry point: settings, server lifecycle, player bridge, boot start |
| `present/AdminServer.java` | HTTP server (port 8080), API, streaming multipart uploads |
| `present/Repo.java`, `Model.java`, `Pairing.java` | SQLite storage, slide model & validation, pairing tokens |
| `present/PresentationActivity.java` | Full-screen player (images, MediaPlayer video, WebView with auto-scroll) |
| `present/PresentIcon.java` | The Presentation tile icon (drawn in code; `assets/present/icon.svg` is the same design) |
| `present/LegacyCss.java`, `Qr.java`, `Net.java` | `@layer` unwrapping for old WebViews, QR bitmaps, LAN URLs |
| `assets/present/` | Browser admin app (`index.html`, `app.css`, `app.js`) |

## Design decisions

- **Measure Apple first.** Geometry comes from Apple's tvOS 26 press screenshot scaled to
  1920×1080 (dock 48 px from the edges, 248×148 px cards, 51 px gaps, dock top at 73%, focus 1.2×)
  and the HIG (60/80 pt safe area, 800×480 icons, focus/pressed states).
- **Liquid Glass without a backdrop-blur API.** The launcher knows what is behind its glass (its
  wallpaper or the carousel artwork), so it bakes a small blurred, saturation-boosted copy once per
  background and the GPU draws glass as shader-filled rounded rectangles aligned to the surface's
  screen position, plus magnified edge bands (lensing) and a gradient specular rim.
- **Recommendations without system access.** Android's preview/Watch Next rows need a
  system-signature permission (verified: 0 rows readable), so the top shelf uses JustWatch/TMDB
  and Continue Watching uses published media sessions.

## Performance (Mi Box, Mali-450 MP, GLES 2.0)

- Startup: the app list (package manager, banners, icon colours) and the wallpaper are prepared on
  background threads while the window's views are built: cold start ~1.0 s → ~0.86 s on a 1 GHz
  Android 9 TV.

- No perpetual animations (no wallpaper drift, no idle sway): idle draws 0 frames.
- Nothing is rendered in software on the UI thread during transitions (the original glass cache
  caused ~1 s freezes moving to/from the dock).
- Legibility gradients are baked into the wallpaper and artwork; the window background is removed
  to avoid hidden full-screen fills.
- Measure with `adb shell dumpsys gfxinfo com.petrobot.hume` — dock navigation runs at a 16 ms
  median; full-screen transitions are limited by the GPU's fill rate (~30 fps on this box).
